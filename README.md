# [Homebrew][] tap with formulae and casks for [Pharo](https://pharo.org)

[homebrew]: https://brew.sh

## Requirements

- [Homebrew][] in an acceptably recent macOS

## Usage

You can now install our casks, e.g. PharoÂ Launcher:
```sh
$ brew cask install pharo-project/pharo/pharo-launcher
```

Note that the name of the tap appears explicitly in the above command; this is
necessary to disambiguate `pharo` and `pharo-launcher` from the existing casks
in `caskroom/homebrew-casks`.
